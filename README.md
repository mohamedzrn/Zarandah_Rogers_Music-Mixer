# Rapper-Mashup Music Mixer 
The user playing with the website has 6 sounds to play with. Within the sounds there are 3 rappers (shaded in color red) and 3 beats (shaded in color yellow). It is up to the user to determine which beat and vocal matches the best (HINT: they are next to each other!!) to MASHUP a song! It is also upto the user to know at what time to drop the beats and the vocals. Make sure to drop the beats and vocals at the right time.
