# Assignment Description
The checkpoint is a way to report to your Managers (or the prof) the current progress of the work that you have been working on so far / how you intend to continue to implement your strategy for your assignments. For the Authoring class, I expect to see the following:


# Detailed Requirements
1. Github repos set up for each project with team access (both members contributing).
Readme should be updated / done; any instructions should be in place.
2. Drag and drop functionality should be done (doesn’t have to be perfect) Audio should
play on a drop (doesn’t have to be perfect). Audio tracks should be layered / however
your project “works” should be roughly finished
3. Design should be 75 - 80% done; any FPO artwork should be removed.
4. Dev / design notes / bug reports for the project (what’s breaking, research into how to fix
bugs, etc… any design improvements that need to be made)


# TODO:
In this project we are creating a drag'n drop feature system where the icons have faces of rappers and are listed in the bottom of the webpage where they can be selected and dropped into the same feature box that is grey shaded. As soon as the face looking box are dragged onto the grey shaded box above, the celebrities trademark sounds start to play and now the grey shaded box is changed to high-fidelity icons
